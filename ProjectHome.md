Allows the user to select a gallery on their android device which will be cycled through at a user-defined interval. Images are scaled, cropped and rotated to fill the users screen in either portrait or landscape modes.

## How to use ##

---

This is a live wallpaper, to use it go to Settings > Wallpapers > Live Wallpapers > Wallpaper Slideshow on your Android device. From here you can configure the wallpaper options and set it as your current wallpaper. During normal operation there is no user interface, the images from your selected gallery will rotate as the home screen wallpaper.
